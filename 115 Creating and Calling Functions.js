// 1-Can not start the name of function with a number like 1getmilk()
function getMilk(){
    alert("leave house")
    alert("go out")
    alert("give money")
    alert("bring milk")   
} //no ; needed here at the end of function

getMilk(); //we do need ; while calling the function though


// 2-Different between console.log() and alert() is that the console can only be seen by the developer but the alert
//can be seen by the user as well as the developer
