// 1-Increment
var x = 5;
x = x + 1; //prints 6
x++; //prints 6

// 2-Decrement
x = x - 1; //prints 4
x--;


// 3- Inc and dec:
x += y //x is incremented by y
x -+ y //x is decremented by y

//Quiz: ****
//What does y  equal?
var x = 3;
var y = x++;
y += 1; // prints 4 
//In this line: var y = x++ the value of x is assigned to y before x is //incremented, so y equals 3 on line 2, while x equals 4. There fore on line 3, y //now equals 4 instead of 5.
